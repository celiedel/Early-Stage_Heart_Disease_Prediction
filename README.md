# Early-Stage Heart Disease Prediction
**Evaluating multiple models for detecting early-stage heart disease**

According to the World Health Organization, heart disease, or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) take an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, around 32% of all deaths globally. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels such as cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and rheumatic heart disease. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes; and one-third of these deaths occur in people under the age of 70.

People with cardiovascular diseases or those at high risk for developing them due to the presence of one or more risk factors would benefit greatly from early detection and management. A fast, accurate, and simple to use machine learning based diagnostic tool can assist health care practitioners in reducing the morbidity and mortality of these diseases.

**The project evaluates the following models:**

• Dummy Classifier (Baseline)

• Logistic Regression

• Decision Tree

• Random Forest

• XGBoost

• Support Vector Machine

• K-Nearest Neighbors

• Stacked Classifiers

• Fully Connected Neural Network


**Datasets used in this project:**

1. UCI Machine Learning Heart Disease dataset
